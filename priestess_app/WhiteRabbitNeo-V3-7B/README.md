# Technical Overview

Priestess is a finetune of [Qwen2.5-Coder-7B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B/), and inherits the following features:
- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
- Number of Parameters: 7.61B
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B
- Number of Layers: 28
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV
- Context Length: Full 131,072 tokens
  - Please refer to [this section](#processing-long-texts) for detailed instructions on how to deploy Priestess for handling long texts.


## Requirements

We advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.

With `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2'
```

## Quickstart

Here provides a code snippet with `apply_chat_template` to show you how to load the tokenizer and model and how to generate contents.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "path/to/priestess-model"

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto"
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

prompt = "write a quick sort algorithm."
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are Priestess, an AI assistant. You are a helpful assistant that is an expert in Cybersecurity and DevOps."},
    {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]
text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True
)
model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=512
)
generated_ids = [
    output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]

response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```

### Processing Long Texts

The current `config.json` is set for context length up to 32,768 tokens.
To handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.

For supported frameworks, you could add the following to `config.json` to enable YaRN:
```json
{
  ...,
  "rope_scaling": {
    "factor": 4.0,
    "original_max_position_embeddings": 32768,
    "type": "yarn"
  }
}
```
